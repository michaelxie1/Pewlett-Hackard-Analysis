# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


Overview:
The purpose of this assignment is to get an understanding of SQL and learn how to both upload and retrieve data from and into databases.  It also allowed for us to filter and extract the data that we needed, utilizing the syntax of SQL to create queries and joins.
